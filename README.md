# Gamma-Hadron Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying celestial objects as either "gamma" or "hadron" based on their physical characteristics. The classification is an important task in astrophysics and particle physics, as it helps identify gamma-ray sources, which are crucial for understanding various cosmic phenomena.

## Code Explanation

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

- The project begins by loading a dataset from a file named "magic04.data." The dataset contains various features of celestial objects and their corresponding classes.

- The "class" column is converted into binary labels, where "g" is mapped to 1 (gamma) and "h" to 0 (hadron).

- The code visualizes the feature distributions for both classes using histograms, providing insights into the data.

### Data Splitting

- The dataset is split into three parts: training, validation, and test sets. These sets are used to train, tune, and evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

### Data Scaling and Oversampling

- The `scale_data` function scales the features using StandardScaler. Optionally, it oversamples the training data using RandomOverSampler to address class imbalance, a common issue in many classification problems.

### K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

- The project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scikit-learn to create and train KNN classifiers with different values of k (1, 3, and 5).

- For each KNN classifier, the code evaluates the model's performance using the test set and prints a classification report. The report includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into the classifier's performance.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `your_notebook.ipynb`.

3. Run each cell in the notebook in order to execute the code and see the results.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the Jupyter Notebook:

1. Run each cell in the notebook in order to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. Ensure you have the required dataset (e.g., `magic04.data`) in the same directory as the notebook.

## Results

The project provides insights into the classification of celestial objects as "gamma" or "hadron." The classification report includes metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, helping to assess the model's performance.
